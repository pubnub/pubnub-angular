# Annotated Source Code for the PubNub AngularJS library.
# Welcome! Thank you for reading this documentation - if you have any feedback or suggestions, please file a GitHub issue and we'll take a look right away!
# 
# Using this library should be as easy as:
#
# 1. Install the library using `bower install pubnub-angular`
# 2. Include the JS libraries for pubnub and pubnub-angular into your HTML using SCRIPT tags
# 3. Declare a dependency on "pubnub.angular.service" in your application's Angular module
# 4. Inject the PubNub service object into your AngularJS services and controllers as you see fit!
#
# For step-by-step instructions, check out https://github.com/pubnub/pubnub-angular/blob/master/README.md
